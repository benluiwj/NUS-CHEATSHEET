# cs-and-other-cheatsheets
Cheatsheets from NUS CS and other mods that I took during my 4 years in school :)

Please let me know if there are any conceptual errors (I hope not), spelling, or other things! 

P.S. These cheatsheets are from a non high flyer and someone just trying Latex out, so pardon the formatting of some of the cheatsheets...
